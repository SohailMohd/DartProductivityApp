Dart Productivity App

Problem Statement
In Middle School and High Schools students receive Agendas and planners to use to keep track of school work. Students have a place to recodrd their assignemtns, when things are due, and prioritize tasks.  
The goal of the project will be to create a simple productivity app to record student data and use tools to help them at school. The main feature of the app will be its To Do List.
The mini apps will be clustered in one place for easy access and time saving features.  The language used to solve this problem is Dart programming language developed by Google.

A brief survey of alternatives
The main alternative to Dart is JavaScript. Google decided that JavaScript should be rewritten with cleaner code and optimized performance. The Dart language does not stray too far from the coding elements of JavaScript but it does have some unique features which makes the language productive. 
JavaScript has spin offs that makes the code simplified like jQuery, Note.js, etc. which extend its features. 


Build Tools
There are various tools available for Dart. Firstly, the Dart SDK needs to be downloaded for development purposes. The Dart lang site also allows developers to use their DartPad tool for simple app testing inside browsers without the need for the SDK. But more complex applications require the SDK. Next an IDE or text editors is needed. Dart recommends the WebStorm IDE and the environment has to be set up. I briefly experimented with this IDE and the also another one called Dart Editor, but I preferred using Atom. 
I use Atom for my web development projects because it has a minimalist design, and has lots of plugins. To support the Dart language on Atom I had to add Dart plugins to recognize the SDK, and highlight text support.

Language Features
Dart offers code that combines jQuery and JavaScript for selecting html elements and modifying them.
